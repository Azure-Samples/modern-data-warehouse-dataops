### Planned vs. Done

_This typically would be described at the EPIC/Workstream level and provide a high-level view of progress vs plan.
Note: Whenever possible link to artifacts from sources such as ADO vs pasting content from other documents_

| Epic / Workstream | Plan for the month | Status | Comments |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ------ | -------- |
| Workstream1       | Y/N                | Y/N    | Y/N      | Y/N |
| Workstream2       | Y/N                | Y/N    | Y/N      | Y/N |
| Workstream3       | Y/N                | Y/N    | Y/N      | Y/N |
| Workstream4       | Y/N                | Y/N    | Y/N      | Y/N |

Question to add into talk track:

- What was planned to be done this month?
- What was actually done this month?
- Changes in plan versus last
- Key design decisions and their outcomes

###  Key Changes / Decisions / Outcomes
_This is a list of any decisions or architecture changes that have been made since the last checkpoint and the action plan for remediation.
Note: Whenever possible link to artifacts from sources such as ADO vs pasting content.  You can keep a decision log in your project repo or wiki to preserve this information for the customer._

| Key Decision / Architectural change | Remediation Plan |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Key Decision 1                      | Y/N              |
