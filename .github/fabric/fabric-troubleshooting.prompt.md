### 2. Information Gathering

For the issue I'm experiencing, please ask me relevant questions to gather diagnostic information:

#### Environment and Context Questions
- What environment is affected (development, staging, production)?
- When did the issue first occur?
- Has anything changed recently (deployments, configuration updates, etc.)?
- Is this affecting all users or specific individuals/groups?
- What is the frequency and pattern of the issue?

#### Technical Details Questions
- What are the specific error messages or symptoms?
- Are there any relevant log entries or stack traces?
- What authentication method is being used?
- Which Azure region and Fabric capacity are involved?
- What is the current configuration of affected resources?

#### Recent Changes Questions
- Have there been recent deployments or infrastructure changes?
- Were any new libraries or dependencies added?
- Have security policies or permissions been modified?
- Are there any ongoing maintenance activities or system updates?

### 3. Diagnostic Commands and Checks

Based on the issue type, provide specific diagnostic commands and checks:

#### Infrastructure Diagnostics
```bash
# Terraform state and configuration checks
terraform state list
terraform plan -detailed-exitcode
terraform show -json | jq '.values.root_module.resources'

# Azure resource validation
az resource list --resource-group <rg-name> --output table
az storage account check-name --name <storage-account-name>
az keyvault secret list --vault-name <vault-name>
```

#### Authentication Diagnostics
```powershell
# Service principal and token validation
az ad sp show --id <service-principal-id>
az account get-access-token --resource https://api.fabric.microsoft.com
az role assignment list --assignee <service-principal-id>

# Fabric API connectivity test
$headers = @{'Authorization' = "Bearer $accessToken"}
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces" -Headers $headers
```

#### Pipeline Diagnostics
```yaml
# Azure DevOps pipeline investigation
az pipelines build list --project <project-name> --status failed
az pipelines variable-group list --project <project-name>
az pipelines runs show --project <project-name> --id <run-id>
```

#### Fabric Workspace Diagnostics
```python
# Fabric workspace health checks
import requests

def check_workspace_health(workspace_id, access_token):
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'}
    
    # Check workspace status
    workspace_url = f"https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}"
    workspace_response = requests.get(workspace_url, headers=headers)
    
    # Check lakehouses
    lakehouses_url = f"{workspace_url}/lakehouses"
    lakehouses_response = requests.get(lakehouses_url, headers=headers)
    
    # Check data pipelines
    pipelines_url = f"{workspace_url}/dataPipelines"
    pipelines_response = requests.get(pipelines_url, headers=headers)
    
    return {
        'workspace_status': workspace_response.status_code,
        'lakehouses_count': len(lakehouses_response.json().get('value', [])),
        'pipelines_count': len(pipelines_response.json().get('value', []))
    }
```

### 4. Common Issue Resolution Patterns

Provide step-by-step resolution guidance for the identified issue:

#### Terraform State Issues
1. **State Lock Resolution**:
   ```bash
   # Check for state locks
   terraform force-unlock <lock-id>
   
   # Backup and refresh state
   terraform state pull > backup.tfstate
   terraform refresh
   ```

2. **State Drift Correction**:
   ```bash
   # Import existing resources
   terraform import <resource-type>.<resource-name> <azure-resource-id>
   
   # Plan and apply corrections
   terraform plan -out=fix.tfplan
   terraform apply fix.tfplan
   ```

#### Authentication Failures
1. **Service Principal Token Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Regenerate service principal secret
   az ad sp credential reset --id <service-principal-id>
   
   # Update Key Vault with new secret
   az keyvault secret set --vault-name <vault> --name "sp-secret" --value <new-secret>
   
   # Update variable groups
   az pipelines variable-group variable update --group-id <id> --name "CLIENT_SECRET" --value <new-secret>
   ```

2. **Fabric API Permission Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Check required API permissions
   az ad app permission list --id <app-id>
   
   # Grant admin consent
   az ad app permission admin-consent --id <app-id>
   ```

#### Pipeline Execution Failures
1. **Variable Group Configuration**:
   ```yaml
   # Validate variable group references
   - task: AzureCLI@2
     inputs:
       azureSubscription: 'service-connection'
       scriptType: 'bash'
       scriptLocation: 'inlineScript'
       inlineScript: |
         echo "Checking variable groups..."
         az pipelines variable-group list --project $(System.TeamProject)
         
         echo "Current variables:"
         env | grep -E "(AZURE_|FABRIC_)" | sort
   ```

2. **Deployment Pipeline Fixes**:
   ```powershell
   # Reset deployment pipeline state
   $headers = @{'Authorization' = "Bearer $fabricToken"}
   $pipelineId = "<deployment-pipeline-id>"
   
   # Get pipeline status
   $status = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/pipelines/$pipelineId" -Headers $headers
   
   # Cancel stuck deployments
   if ($status.deployments | Where-Object {$_.status -eq "InProgress"}) {
       # Cancel deployment logic
   }
   ```

#### Data Pipeline Issues
1. **Notebook Execution Failures**:
   ```python
   # Debug notebook issues
   import traceback
   import logging
   
   # Enable detailed logging
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
   
   try:
       # Your notebook code here
       pass
   except Exception as e:
       logger.error(f"Notebook execution failed: {str(e)}")
       logger.error(traceback.format_exc())
       raise
   ```

2. **Data Access Issues**:
   ```python
   # Test lakehouse connectivity
   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
   
   spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()
   
   # Test table access
   try:
       df = spark.sql("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lakehouse.table_name")
       print(f"Table accessible: {df.collect()[0][0]} rows")
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Table access failed: {e}")
   
   # Test file system access
   try:
       files = spark.sql("LIST '/lakehouse/Files/'")
       files.show()
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"File system access failed: {e}")
   ```
