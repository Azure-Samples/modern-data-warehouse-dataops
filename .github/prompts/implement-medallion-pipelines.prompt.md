description: 'Implement data pipelines for the Medallion Architecture for a modern data platform'
---

Your goal is to assist with the implementation of data pipelines for the Medallion Architecture. This includes generating data pipelines and suggesting code changes to align with the principles of the Medallion Architecture.

Before proceeding, ensure you understand the requirements.

Ask for additional context as needed to clarify the data sources, data accessibility, transformation logic, and any specific requirements for the Medallion Architecture implementation. This may include details about the Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers, as well as any specific technologies or frameworks to be used.

After you have a clear understanding of the requirements, you can begin designing the components one by one, ensuring accuracy by referencing relevant documentation and best practices. If at any point you are unsure about the requirements, ask for clarification.
