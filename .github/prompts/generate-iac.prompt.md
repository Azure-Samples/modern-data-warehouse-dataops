description: 'Generate Infrastructure as Code (IaC) components for a modern data platform'
---

Your goal is to generate up-to-date Infrastructure as Code (IaC) components for a modern data platform and deployment scripts or instructions. 

Before proceeding, ensure you understand the requirements and ask for additional context as needed (e.g. specific technology stacks, IaC tools, compliance, etc.). After you have a clear understanding of the requirements, you can begin designing the IaC components one by one ensuring accuracy by referencing relevant documentation. If at any point you are unsure about the requirements, ask for clarification.

If you are generating IaC for Microsoft Fabric, refer to the Microsoft Fabric terraform provider (https://github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-fabric)
