# Microsoft Fabric DataOps Engineering Instructions

This document provides guidance for implementing DataOps best practices in Microsoft Fabric projects, based on proven patterns from enterprise implementations.

## Core DataOps Principles for Fabric

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Use Terraform** with the Microsoft Fabric provider for consistent deployments
- **Separate concerns**: Azure resources (storage, Key Vault) from Fabric resources (workspaces, lakehouses)
- **Store Terraform state remotely** for team collaboration (Azure Storage backend)
- **Use parameter files** for environment-specific configurations
- **Implement proper resource naming** following conventions: `ws-{project}-{env}`, `lh-{name}`, etc.

### CI/CD Pipeline Strategy
- **Implement Git-based deployment** with Fabric workspace integration
- **Use Fabric deployment pipelines** for promotion between environments
- **Separate CI from CD**: Quality assurance (CI) vs. deployment (CD) processes
- **Include manual approval gates** for production deployments
- **Maintain environment parity** across dev/staging/production

### Testing Strategy
- **Python unit tests** for data processing logic and utility functions
- **Fabric unit tests** for workspace configuration validation
- **Integration tests** for end-to-end pipeline validation
- **Ephemeral workspace creation** for pull request validation
- **Test data management** with synthetic data and proper versioning

### Environment Management
- **Maintain environment parity** between dev/staging/production
- **Use Azure DevOps variable groups** for environment-specific settings
- **Implement proper secret management** with Azure Key Vault integration
- **Follow consistent naming conventions** across all environments
- **Document environment-specific configurations** and dependencies

### Medallion Architecture Implementation
- **Bronze layer**: Raw data ingestion to lakehouse with timestamp-based organization
- **Silver layer**: Cleaned and validated data with applied business rules
- **Gold layer**: Business-ready dimensional models optimized for analytics
- **Use shortcuts** for efficient data access across layers and external sources
- **Implement data lineage tracking** with Microsoft Purview integration

## Security and Governance

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Use service principals** for automated deployments and CI/CD
- **Implement least privilege access** with proper role-based security
- **Configure workspace roles** appropriately (Admin, Member, Contributor, Viewer)
- **Secure connection strings** and secrets in Azure Key Vault
- **Document security group assignments** and access patterns

### Data Governance
- **Implement data classification** using sensitivity labels
- **Enable audit logging** for workspace activities and data access
- **Configure data lineage tracking** with Purview integration
- **Establish data retention policies** aligned with compliance requirements
- **Document data sources and transformations** for regulatory compliance

## Monitoring and Observability

### Application Insights Integration
- **Configure telemetry collection** for custom metrics and performance monitoring
- **Implement custom dashboards** for operational visibility
- **Set up alerting rules** for critical failures and performance degradation
- **Monitor resource utilization** and optimize capacity allocation
- **Track deployment success rates** and pipeline performance

### Log Management
- **Centralize log aggregation** using Log Analytics Workspace
- **Implement structured logging** in notebooks and data pipelines
- **Configure retention policies** for operational and audit logs
- **Create custom queries** for troubleshooting and performance analysis
- **Set up automated alerting** for error conditions and anomalies

## Development Workflow

### Git Integration Best Practices
- **Connect workspace to Git repository** with proper branch strategy
- **Use feature branches** for development and pull requests for code review
- **Sync workspace changes** back to Git to maintain version control
- **Implement branch protection rules** to enforce code review and testing
- **Document Git directory structure** and workspace synchronization process

### Code Organization
- **Separate infrastructure code** from application code in repository structure
- **Use consistent folder structure** across projects for maintainability
- **Implement code review processes** for all changes including notebooks
- **Document data processing logic** with clear comments and documentation
- **Version control all artifacts** including notebooks, pipelines, and configurations

## Performance Optimization

### Lakehouse Design
- **Optimize data partitioning** strategies based on query patterns
- **Implement efficient file formats** (Delta, Parquet) for storage and performance
- **Use data shortcuts** strategically to minimize data movement
- **Configure appropriate compression** settings for storage optimization
- **Monitor query performance** and optimize based on usage patterns

### Pipeline Optimization
- **Design for parallel processing** where possible to improve throughput
- **Implement incremental data processing** to minimize resource usage
- **Use appropriate compute resources** based on workload requirements
- **Monitor and optimize** Spark configurations for better performance
- **Implement data caching** strategies for frequently accessed datasets

## Troubleshooting Guidelines

### Common Issues and Solutions
- **Authentication failures**: Verify service principal permissions and token expiration
- **Deployment pipeline issues**: Check variable group configurations and environment settings
- **Git synchronization problems**: Ensure proper branch mapping and resolve conflicts
- **Performance degradation**: Monitor resource utilization and optimize query patterns
- **Data quality issues**: Implement validation rules and monitoring in data pipelines

### Diagnostic Tools
- **Use Application Insights** for performance monitoring and error tracking
- **Leverage Fabric monitoring** capabilities for workspace and pipeline health
- **Implement custom logging** in notebooks for detailed troubleshooting
- **Monitor Terraform state** for infrastructure drift and configuration issues
- **Use Azure DevOps insights** for pipeline performance and failure analysis

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Management
- **Right-size compute resources** based on actual workload requirements
- **Implement auto-scaling** policies where supported
- **Monitor capacity utilization** and optimize allocation
- **Use reserved capacity** for predictable workloads to reduce costs
- **Implement resource tagging** for cost allocation and tracking

### Data Storage Optimization
- **Implement data lifecycle policies** for automatic archival of old data
- **Optimize file sizes and formats** to reduce storage costs
- **Use compression** appropriately to balance storage and compute costs
- **Monitor data growth patterns** and plan capacity accordingly
- **Implement data retention policies** aligned with business requirements

## Compliance and Auditing

### Regulatory Requirements
- **Implement data residency** controls as required by regulations
- **Configure audit trails** for all data access and modifications
- **Document data processing activities** for compliance reporting
- **Implement data subject rights** processes (GDPR, CCPA compliance)
- **Maintain security certifications** and compliance documentation

### Documentation Standards
- **Document all architectural decisions** with rationale and alternatives considered
- **Maintain runbooks** for operational procedures and incident response
- **Document data lineage** and transformation logic for audit purposes
- **Keep security procedures** up to date with current threat landscape
- **Document disaster recovery** and business continuity procedures

## Team Collaboration

### Knowledge Sharing
- **Implement code review processes** for all changes including infrastructure
- **Document best practices** and lessons learned from project experience
- **Conduct regular architecture reviews** to ensure alignment with standards
- **Share reusable components** and patterns across teams
- **Maintain technical documentation** current with implementation changes

### Training and Development
- **Provide training** on Fabric capabilities and DataOps practices
- **Establish mentoring programs** for team members new to the platform
- **Encourage experimentation** with new features in development environments
- **Share knowledge** through internal presentations and documentation
- **Stay current** with Fabric updates and new capabilities
