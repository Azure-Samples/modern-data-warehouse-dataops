## 1. Solution Overview

The purpose of this solution is to demonstrate the creation of Azure storage accounts/containers and configuring the data lifecycle rules at scale using Terraform based IaC templates.

The solution takes details about the storage accounts, containers and lifecycle rules as JSON configuration and apply it in a loop which makes it flexible, extensible and scalable to accommodate any number of storage accounts, containers and data life cycle rules.

### 1.1. Scope

The following items will be provisioned as a part of this sample setup:

- Azure Storage Accounts
- Storage Containers
- Data lifecycle rules

### 1.2. Use Case

It is desirable to reduce the costs by optimizing the resource usage costs in cloud environments.

Data lifecycle is one such feature on Azure using which you can optimize costs by moving your data to lower cost tiers when their access is less frequent. It also supports deleting obselete data to save costs.For additional information, please check the Microsoft [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/lifecycle-management-overview).

 Data lifecycle rules can be defiened to move data from one tier to other. This solution provides Infra As Code script written in Terraform, to provision these rules in Azure.

### 1.3. Technologies used

The following technologies are used to build this sample:

- [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/data-lake-storage)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io)

## 2. How to use this sample

This section holds the information about usage instructions of this sample.

### 2.1. Prerequisites

The following are the prerequisites for deploying this sample:

- [Github account](https://github.com)
- [Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/search/?&ef_id=Cj0KCQiAr8bwBRD4ARIsAHa4YyLdFKh7JC0jhbxhwPeNa8tmnhXciOHcYsgPfNB7DEFFGpNLTjdTPbwaAh8bEALw_wcB:G:s&OCID=AID2000051_SEM_O2ShDlJP&MarinID=O2ShDlJP_332092752199_azure%20account_e_c__63148277493_aud-390212648371:kwd-295861291340&lnkd=Google_Azure_Brand&dclid=CKjVuKOP7uYCFVapaAoddSkKcA)
  - *Permissions needed*:  The ability to create and deploy to an Azure [resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview), a [service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals), and grant the [collaborator role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) to the service principal over the resource group.

  - Active subscription with `Microsoft.Storage` [resource providers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers) enabled.

#### 2.1.1 Software Prerequisites

- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure) installed on the local machine.
  - Installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) installed on the local machine.
  - Installation instructions can be found [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads).
  - Minimum required version is 1.3.x or later.

### 2.2. Setup and deployment

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** As with all Azure Deployments, this will **incur associated costs**. Remember to teardown all related resources after use to avoid unnecessary costs. See [here](#23-deployed-resources) for a list of deployed resources.

Below listed are the steps to deploy this sample:

- Fork and clone this repository. Navigate to  `single_tech_samples/storage/sample1_data_lifecycle/terraform`.

- The sample depends on the variables to be set before the deployment script is run; You can set these variables by editing the variables.tf and terraform.auto.tfvars files, otherwise the default values provided would be considered.

The script is configuration driven and based on a variable of type `map(map(map)))`.

- First level map represents storage accounts.
- Second level map represents the containers inside the respective storage account.
- Third level map represents the data life cycle rules under respective container.

Sample variable format is shown below:

```txt
storage_account_container_config = {
    "StorageAccountName1" = {
        "Container1"       = { "LifeCycleAction1" : "NumberOfDays", "LifeCycleAction2" : "NumberOfDays"}
    }
    "StorageAccountName2" = {
        "Container2"       = { "LifeCycleAction1" : "NumberOfDays", "LifeCycleAction1" : "NumberOfDays" }
    }
    "StorageAccountName3" = {
        "Container3"       = { "LifeCycleAction1" : "NumberOfDays" }
        "Container4"       = {   }
    }
}
```

Configure as many storage accounts, containers and lifecycle rules as needed and run the IAC script provided in this git repo.

Run below commands in the sequence:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

   > Note: The script would expect that you are logged in to the Azure account using az login command, before you deploy resources to Azure.

### 2.3. Deployed Resources

The following resources will be deployed as a part of this sample once the script is executed:

- Azure Storage Accounts.
- Azure Storage Containers.
- Azure data lifecycle rules.

### 2.4. Deployment validation and Execution

The following steps can be performed to validate the correct deployment and execution of the sample:

Users with appropriate access rights should be able to:

- View the storage accounts in the Azure portal.
- View the storage containers under the storage accounts through the Azure portal.
- View the data lifecycle rules created in the Azure portal under storage accounts.

Here are the detail steps on how to execute the sample:

- Checkout the code.
- Configure the variables as needed under the files variables.tf and terraform.auto.tfvars.
- Here is the sequence of commands to run from the main directory:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

After you run the above commands successfully, you should be able to see the following items under your Azure Subscription:

- Azure Storage Accounts.

![alt text](../common_assets/images/storage_accounts.png "Logo Title Text 1")
 It can be observed that the storage accountsâ€™ names have embedded random letters, which makes them unique. This is achieved by using the [azurecaf](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aztfmod/azurecaf/latest/docs/resources/azurecaf_name) feature.

- Azure Storage Containers.

![alt text](../common_assets/images/storage_containers.png "Logo Title Text 1")

- Azure data lifecycle rules.

![alt text](../common_assets/images/data_lifecycle_rules.png "Logo Title Text 1")

### 2.5. Clean-up

The clean-up script can be executed to clean up the resources provisioned in this sample.

Following are the steps to execute the script:

- Navigate to `single_tech_samples/storage/sample1_data_lifecycle/terraform`.

- Run terraform destroy command:

   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

## 3. Troubleshooting

### Error Building AzureRM Client

If you run the terraform plan command, you may run into the following error:

```bash
Error: building AzureRM Client: obtain subscription() from Azure CLI: parsing json result from the Azure CLI: waiting for the Azure CLI: exit status 1: ERROR: No subscription found. Run 'az account set' to select a subscription.
with provider["registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/azurerm"],
on provider.tf line 14, in provider "azurerm":
14: provider "azurerm" {

```

This is usually happen when terraform is unable to find Azure Subscription. The core issue behind this is that user is not logged to Azure account.

In order to fix this you must login to Azure using the following command:

```bash
az login
```
