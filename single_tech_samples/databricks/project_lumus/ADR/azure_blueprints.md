# :bulb: Is there value in associating Azure Blueprints and the ARM templates for Azure Databricks from the perspective of enterprise requirements?

:calendar: Date: 10th March, 2021

## :heavy_check_mark: Status

In-Progress

## :dart: Context

* WW Communities were consulted for any reference on Enterprise scenarios where Azure Blueprints is used for deploying Azure Databricks
  * No references such scenarios were found
  * It came to light that Azure Blueprints may encounter a change of direction in terms of product roadmap. This volatile nature of the service may make it less suitable to be used for the present sample.
