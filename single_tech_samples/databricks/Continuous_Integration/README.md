# Setting up a Continuous Integration pipeline
## 1. Objective
As per Microsoft Documentation, Continuous Integration (CI) is the process of automating the build and testing of code every time code changes are committed to the version control. CI is a best practice encouraged in agile development teams as it enables team members to work in isolation, and then integrate their changes with the teamâ€™s codebase while minimizing regressions.

This pattern is also applicable to development teams responsible for authoring notebooks deployed on Azure Databricks. This sample focuses on demonstrating the Continues Integration pipeline for Azure Databricks notebooks. 

### 1.1 Scope
As captured in the [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/ci-cd/ci-cd-azure-devops), a typical CI cycle will involve the following steps:
* Code
  * Develop code and unit tests in a Databricks notebook or using an external IDE.
  * Manually run tests.
  * Commit code and tests to a git branch.
* Build
  * Gather new and updated code and tests.
  * Run automated tests.
  * Build libraries and non-notebook Apache Spark code.
* Release: Generate a release artifact.
