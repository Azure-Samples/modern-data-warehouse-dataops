
TO DO:

WIP

Merge this with Obervability writeup - the generic one with all the possible stuff

- db utils
- file utils
- resource management utils
  - can we use user activity to see if a capacity is in use?

AI principles:
- Explainable/Visible AI
- Show first - do not implement 
  - Two way doors/recoverability


AI centric:
- unusual patterns
- in fliught checks
- ofeten used resources based on the queries
- resources going frequent changes - etimate the freq of changes
  - identify usgae patterns and plan for maintenance - don't perform vaccum every single day

Others
- Vaccum 
- disbaled/invalid assets asset identfication
- archiving
- pausing Fabric capacity 
- database connection tests
- high priority assets sanity checks(tables are valid)
- indexing and storage monitoring
- unusual patterns of consumption (db queries etc - if we can get that data - look at bigger patterns of monitoring data - at aggregate levels)
- Adding other aspects of monitoring - user data and security data
  - monitoring hub data as of now is not available
  - we can item execution apis and store those details periodically

Explore: is there any way in Fabric to have something like all_queries equivalent?

---------------------------------Level 2 ----------------------

Analytics
- boxed queries
- combining ops data with biz data
AI centric:
- unusual patterns
- ofeten used resources based on the queries
- resources going frequent changes - etimate the freq of changes
  - identify usgae patterns and plan for maintenance - don't perform vaccum every single day
- Copilots
Data presentation
- Sate of affairs
- alerts
- current resource usage
- last used resource times
- high priortiy source systems satus
