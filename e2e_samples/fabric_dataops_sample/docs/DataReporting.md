# Data Reporting

WIP

See [data visualization](./ThingsToConsiderForDataProcesses.md#visualizations) for details.

## Adding other aspects of monitoring - user data and security data

- Monitoring hub data as of now is not available
- We can item execution apis and store those details periodically

### Kusto Queries 

- can we learn anything from App insights and use those queries here

- Combining operational data with business data

- basic visualizations using Kusto

- graph functionality in Kusto

- create the Powerbi report using either direct lake mode or kusto data
