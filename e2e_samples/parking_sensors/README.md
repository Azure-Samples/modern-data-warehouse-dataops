# DataDevOps - Parking Sensor Demo

The sample demonstrate how DevOps principles can be applied end to end Data Pipeline Solution built according to the [Modern Data Warehouse (MDW)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/solutions/architecture/modern-data-warehouse/) pattern. It makes use of the following azure services:
- [Azure Data Factory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/data-factory/)
- [Azure Databricks](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/databricks/)
- [Azure Data Lake Gen2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction)
- [Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQLDW)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/synapse-analytics/)
- [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/devops/)

## Prerequisites
1. Github Account
2. Azure DevOps Account + Project
3. Azure Account

### Software pre-requisites:
1. For Windows users, [Windows Subsystem For Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
2. [az cli 2.x](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
3. [azu cli - storage-preview extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-cli)
4. [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/)
5. [databricks-cli](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/dev-tools/databricks-cli.html)
6. [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

NOTE: This deployment was tested using WSL (Ubuntu 16.04) and Debian GNU/Linux 9.9 (stretch)

## Setup

1. Fork this repository. Forking is necessary if you want to setup git integration with Azure Data Factory.
2. **Deploy Azure resources.** 
    1. Clone the forked repository and `cd` into the root of the repo
    2. Run `./deploy.sh`.
        - This will deploy three Resource Groups (one per environment) each with the following Azure resources.
            - Data Factory (empty) - *next steps will deploy actual data pipelines*.
            - Data Lake Store Gen2 and Service Principal with Storage Contributor rights assigned.
            - Databricks workspace - notebooks uploaded, SparkSQL tables created, and ADLS Gen2 mounted using SP.
            - KeyVault with all secrets stored.
        - This will create a local `.env.{environment_name}` files containing essential configuration information.
        - All Azure resources are tagged with correct Environment.
        - The solution is designed such that **all** starting environment deployment configuration should be specified in the arm.parameters files. This is to centralize configuration.

3. **Setup ADF git integration in DEV Data Factory**
    1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the Data Factory in the **DEV** environment.
    2. Click "Author & Monitor" to launch the Data Factory portal.
    3. On the landing page, select "Set up code repository". For more information, see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/source-control).
    4. Fill in the repository settings with the following:
        - Repository type: **Github**
        - Github Account: ***your_Github_account***
        - Git repository name: **forked Github repository**
        - Collaboration branch: **master**
        - Root folder: **/adf**
        - Import Existing Data Factory resource to respository: **Unselected**
    5. Navigating to "Author" tab, you should see all the pipelines deployed.
    6. Select `Connections` > `Ls_KeyVault`. Update the Base Url to the KeyVault Url of your DEV environment.
    7. Select `Connections` > `Ls_AdlsGen2_01`. Update URL to the ADLS Gen2 Url of your DEV environment.
    8. Click `Publish` to publish changes.

4. **Setup Build Pipelines.** You will be creating two build pipelines, one which will trigger for every pull request which will run Unit Testing + Linting, and the second one which will trigger on every commit to master and will create the actual build artifacts for release.
    1. In Azure DevOps, navigate to `Pipelines`. Select "Create Pipeline".
    2. Under "Where is your code?", select Github (YAML).
        - If you have not yet already, you maybe prompted to connect your Github account. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/github?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#grant-access-to-your-github-repositories) for more information.
    3. Under "Select a repository", select your forked repo.
    4. Under "Configure your pipeline", select "Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file".
        - Branch: master
        - Path: `/src/ddo_transform/azure-pipelines-ci-qa.yaml`
    5. Select `Run`.
    6. Repeat steps 1-4, but select as the path `/src/ddo_transform/azure-pipelines-ci-artifacts`.

5. **Setup Release Pipelines**
    - **WIP**

## Concepts

### Build and Release Pipeline

Both Build and Release Pipelines are built using [AzureDevOps](https://dev.azure.com/) (Public instance) and can be view using the following links:
- [Build Pipelines](https://dev.azure.com/devlacepub/DataDevOps/_build)
- [Release Pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/devlacepub/DataDevOps/_release)

More information [here](./docs/CI_CD.md).
 
### Testing

- Unit Testing - Standard unit tests which tests small pieces of functionality within your code. Data transformation code should have unit tests.

- Integration Testing - This includes end-to-end testing of the ETL pipeline. WIP.

- Data Testing  
    1. Structure - Test for correct schema, expected structure.
    2. Content - Can be tested through quantitative summary statistics and qualitative data quality graphs within the notebook.

### Observability / Monitoring

#### Databricks
- [Monitoring Azure Databricks with Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/databricks-monitoring/)
- [Monitoring Azure Databricks Jobs with Application Insights](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt846727.aspx)

#### Data Factory
- [Monitor Azure Data Factory with Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/monitor-using-azure-monitor)
- [Alerting in Azure Data Factory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/blog/create-alerts-to-proactively-monitor-your-data-factory-pipelines/)


## Known Issues, Limitations and Workarounds
- Databricks KeyVault-backed secrets scopes can only be create via the UI, and thus cannot be created programmatically and was not incorporated in the automated deployment of the solution.
  - **Workaround**: Use normal Databricks secrets with the downside of duplicated information.
- Data Factory Databricks Linked Service does not support dynamic configuration, thus needing a manual step to point to new cluster during deployment of pipeline to a new environment.
  - **Workaround**: Alternative is to create an on-demand cluster however this may introduce latency issues with cluster spin up time. Optionally, user can manually update Linked Service to point to correct cluster.

## Data

### Physical layout

ADLS Gen2 is structured as the following:
------------

    datalake                    <- filesystem
        /libs                   <- contains all libs, jars, wheels needed for processing
        /data
            /lnd                <- landing folder where all data files are ingested into.
            /interim            <- interim (cleanesed) tables
            /dw                 <- final tables 


------------
