# Displaying All Relevant Citations for a Given Question

## Current Approach

Our system currently displays **all citations** that are relevant to a particular question, even when some of them may be duplicates or provide the same answer. This ensures that users have full visibility into the sources supporting an answer, allowing them to:

- Verify information across multiple references.

- Gain confidence in the comprehensiveness of the response.

- Identify nuances or slight variations between sources.

By providing full citation transparency, we enable users to make informed judgments based on multiple authoritative sources.

## Alternative Approach

In some cases, displaying multiple citations that  support the same answer with minimal variation may be overwhelming for the user, especially when the number of duplicates becomes sizable. A potential alternative approach would be to:

- Show **only one** citation per unique answer.

- Prioritize the **most relevant** citation based on factors like source credibility, date/recency, or specificity of context.

- Implement a **collapsing or filtering mechanism** in the UI to reduce redundancy while still allowing users to expand and view all supporting citations if needed.

## Future Considerations

While we have chosen to display all citations for now, users may prefer a more concise view in certain scenarios. If feedback indicates that redundant citations reduce usability, we may explore:

- **Heuristics for filtering citations** that provide essentially the same answer.

- **Collapsible citation grouping** to declutter the interface.

- **User preferences or toggles** that allow users to choose between seeing all citations or only the most relevant one.
