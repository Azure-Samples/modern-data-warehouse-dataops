# DataOps for the Modern Data Warehouse

This repository contains numerous code samples and artifacts on how to apply DevOps principles to data pipelines built according to the [Modern Data Warehouse (MDW)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/solutions/architecture/modern-data-warehouse/) architectural pattern on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/).

The samples are either focused on a single azure service or showcases an end to end data pipeline solution built according to the MDW pattern. Each sample contains code and artifacts relating to:

- Build and Release Pipelines (CI/CD)
- Testing
- Observability / Monitoring

## Contents

### End to End samples

- [**Parking Sensor Solution**](e2e_samples/parking_sensors/) - This demonstrates batch, end-to-end data pipeline following the MDW architecture, along with a corresponding CI/CD process. See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1-OU5cmsw) for the presentation which includes a detailed walk-through of the solution.
  - *Technology stack*: Azure DevOps, Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse and ADLS Gen2.
- [**Temperature Events Solution**](e2e_samples/temperature_events) - This demonstrate a high-scale event-driven data pipeline with a focus on how to implement Observability and Load Testing.
  - *Technology stack*: Azure DevOps, Azure Functions, Terraform, Application Insights, Azure Eventhubs

### Single Technology Samples

- [Azure SQL](single_tech_samples/azuresql/)
- [Data Factory](single_tech_samples/datafactory/)

#### Coming soon

- [Azure Databricks](single_tech_samples/databricks/)
- [Stream Analytics](single_tech_samples/streamanalytics/)
- [Azure Synapse (formerly SQLDW)](single_tech_samples/synapseanalytics/)
- [CosmosDB](single_tech_samples/cosmosdb/)
