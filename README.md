# DataOps for the Modern Data Warehouse

This repository contains numerous code samples and artifacts on how to apply DevOps principles to data pipelines built according to the [Modern Data Warehouse (MDW)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/solutions/architecture/modern-data-warehouse/) architectural pattern on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/).

The samples are either focused on a single azure service (**Single Tech Samples**) or showcases an end to end data pipeline solution as a reference implementation (**End to End Samples**). Each sample contains code and artifacts relating one or more of the following

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Build and Release Pipelines (CI/CD)
- Testing
- Observability / Monitoring

## Single Technology Samples

- [Azure SQL](single_tech_samples/azuresql/)
  - [CI/CD - AzureSQL](single_tech_samples/azuresql/)
- [Data Factory](single_tech_samples/datafactory/)
  - [CI/CD - ADF](single_tech_samples/datafactory/)
- [Azure Synapse Analytics](single_tech_samples/synapseanalytics)
- [Azure Databricks](single_tech_samples/databricks/)
  - [IaC - Basic Azure Databricks deployment](single_tech_samples/databricks/sample1_basic_azure_databricks_environment/)
  - [IaC - Enterprise Security and Data Exfiltration Protection Deployment](single_tech_samples/databricks/sample2_enterprise_azure_databricks_environment/)
  - [IaC - Cluster Provisioning and Secure Data Access](single_tech_samples/databricks/sample3_cluster_provisioning_and_data_access/)
- [Stream Analytics](single_tech_samples/streamanalytics/)
- [Azure Purview](single_tech_samples/purview/)
  - [IaC - Azure Purview](single_tech_samples/purview/)

## End to End samples

- **Parking Sensor Solution** - This demonstrates batch, end-to-end data pipeline following the MDW architecture, along with a corresponding CI/CD process.
![Architecture](docs/images/CI_CD_process_simplified.png?raw=true "Architecture")
  This has two version of the solution:
  - [Azure Data Factory and Azure Databricks Version](e2e_samples/parking_sensors/)
  - [Azure Synapse Version](e2e_samples/parking_sensors_synapse/)
- [**Temperature Events Solution**](e2e_samples/temperature_events) - This demonstrate a high-scale event-driven data pipeline with a focus on how to implement Observability and Load Testing.
![Architecture](e2e_samples/temperature_events/images/temperature-events-architecture.png?raw=true "Architecture")
- [**Dataset Versioning Solution**](e2e_samples/dataset_versioning) - This demonstrates how to use DataFactory to Orchestrate DataFlow, to do DeltaLoads into DeltaLake On DataLake(DoDDDoD).
- [**MDW Data Governance and PII data detection**](e2e_samples/mdw_governance) - This sample demonstrates how to deploy the Infrastructure of an end-to-end MDW Pipeline using [Azure DevOps pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/devops/pipelines/) along with a focus around Data Governance and PII data detection.
