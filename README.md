# DataOps

This repository contains numerous code samples and artifacts on how to apply DevOps principles to common data engineering patterns and architectures utilizing Microsoft data platform technologies.

The samples are either focused on a single microsoft service ([Single-Technology Samples](#single-technology-samples)) or showcases an end-to-end data pipeline solution as a reference implementation ([End-to-End Samples](#end-to-end-samples)). Each sample contains code and artifacts related to one or more of the following capabilities:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Build and Release Pipelines (CI/CD)
- Testing
- Observability / Monitoring

In addition to the samples, this repository also contains [Utilities](#utilities). These are simple scripts or code snippets that can be used as-is or as a starting point for more complex automation tasks.

## End-to-End Samples

### DataOps for Medallion with Azure Data Factory and Azure Databricks

This [sample](e2e_samples/parking_sensors/) demonstrates batch, end-to-end data pipeline utilizing Azure Data Factory and Azure Databricks built according to the [medallion architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/lakehouse/medallion), along with a corresponding CI/CD process, observability and automated testing.

### DataOps for Medallion with Microsoft Fabric

- Coming soon.

## Utilities

| Technology | Utility Description |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Microsoft Fabric | ▪️ [Script to upload file in GIT repo to Fabric lakehouse](./utilities/fabric/README.md#python-script-to-upload-file-in-git-repo-to-fabric-lakehouse)|
