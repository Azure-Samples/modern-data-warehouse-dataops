description: "Code samples showcasing how to apply DevOps concepts to the Modern Data Warehouse Architecture leveraging different Azure Data Technologies."
---

## DataOps for the Modern Data Warehouse

This repository contains numerous code samples and artifacts on how to apply DevOps principles to data pipelines built according to the [Modern Data Warehouse (MDW)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/solutions/architecture/modern-data-warehouse/) architectural pattern on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/). 

The samples are either focused on a single azure service or showcases an end to end data pipeline solution built according to the MDW pattern. Each sample contains code and artifacts relating to:
- Build and Release Pipelines (CI/CD)
- Testing
- Observability / Monitoring

### Single Technology Samples
   - [Azure SQL](single_tech_samples/azuresql/)

   Coming soon..
   - [Data Factory](single_tech_samples/datafactory/)
   - [Azure Databricks](single_tech_samples/databricks/)
   - [Stream Analytics](single_tech_samples/streamanalytics/)
   - [Azure Synapse (formerly SQLDW)](single_tech_samples/synapseanalytics/)
   - [CosmosDB](single_tech_samples/cosmosdb/)

### End to End samples
   - [**Parking Sensor Solution**](e2e_samples/parking_sensors/) - This sample solution demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline following the MDW architecture, along with a corresponding CI/CD process. 
     - This was solution was presented at [NDC Sydney 2019](https://ndcsydney.com/). See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1-OU5cmsw) for the presentation which includes a detailed walkthrough of the solution.
