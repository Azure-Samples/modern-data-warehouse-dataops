## How to use the sample

### Prerequisites

1. [EXAMPLE] [Github account](https://github.com/)

#### Software pre-requisites if you don't use dev container<!-- omit in toc -->

- [EXAMPLE] [az cli x.y+](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

#### Software pre-requisites if you use dev container<!-- omit in toc -->

*EXAMPLE:*

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code Remote Development Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)

1. Rename `.envtemplate` to `devcontainer.env` and update the values as explained in the **Initial Setup** section.
2. Open the project inside the vscode dev container.
3. `cd` into the `e2e/<name-sample>` or `single-tech/<name-of-technology>` folder and run `./deploy.sh` inside the dev container terminal.

### Setup and Deployment

> IMPORTANT NOTE: As with all Azure deployments, this will **incur associated costs**. Remember to teardown all related resources after use to avoid unnecessary costs. See [here](#deployed-resources) for a list of deployed resources.

1. **Initial Setup**

2. **Deploy Azure resources**

Congratulations!! ðŸ¥³ You have successfully deployed the solution!

#### Deployed Resources
